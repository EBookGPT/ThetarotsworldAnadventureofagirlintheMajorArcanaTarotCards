# Chapter 11: The Chariot: Taking Control and Overcoming Obstacles

As our heroine continues her journey through the Major Arcana Tarot Cards, she now finds herself facing a new challenge: that of the formidable Chariot.

Much like Dorothy's journey in the Wizard of Oz, our protagonist must overcome a series of obstacles and challenges that would test even the bravest of souls. The Chariot represents the battle between the conscious and subconscious, the inner struggle to take control, and overcome obstacles to achieve one's goals.

As our girl looks upon the image of the Chariot, she sees a warrior standing steady at the reins of two horses, one white and one black. The horses represent the opposing forces within us, one being desire and one being restraint. But the rider of the chariot shows us that we can control these forces within us and use them to move forward on our path.

Through this journey, our girl will learn how to take the reins and navigate through the obstacles in her life. She will draw on her inner strength and determination to achieve her goals and overcome any setbacks that come her way.

Join her on her adventure through the Major Arcana Tarot Cards as she learns the powerful lesson of The Chariot: that true control and success comes not from external factors, but from within.
# The Chariot: A Wizard of Oz Parable

Our heroine found herself standing at the edge of a vast, turbulent river. She knew that she needed to cross it to continue on her journey, but the raging water seemed like an insurmountable obstacle. 

Just then, a chariot appeared before her like magic, driven by a brave warrior. As he approached, he urged our girl to hop aboard, promising to help her cross the river and reach her ultimate destination.

As our girl climbed up into the chariot, she saw that it was being pulled by two horses, one white and one black. The warrior explained to her that these horses represented the opposing forces within herself- the desire to take control and the restraint holding her back.

With a firm grip on the reins of the chariot, the warrior guided the horses across the treacherous river. Our girl felt the power of the horses as they crossed the rapids and finally reached the other side.

As they continued on their journey, our girl realized that the warrior's guidance wasn't all she needed to overcome obstacles- she needed to take control herself to reach her ultimate destination. She called upon her inner strength and determination to take the reins, navigating through the dangers that lay ahead.

Through her journey with the Chariot, our girl learns that although obstacles may seem insurmountable, they can be overcome with the right mindset and guidance. She learns to take control of her own destiny, to guide her own horses in life with confidence and determination, and ultimately reach the destination that she seeks.
The journey with the Chariot has shown our girl that true success and control comes from within. She has learned that she can overcome any obstacle, no matter how daunting, by taking control of her own thoughts, actions, and emotions. 

Through this journey, she has embraced her inner warrior, finding the strength to harness opposing forces within herself and use them to move forward. And with the guidance of the Chariot, she has navigated the path to achieve her ultimate goals.

Our girl's journey through the Major Arcana Tarot Cards has been one of self-discovery and empowerment. The lessons she has learned with the Chariot will stay with her always, empowering her to take control of her own destiny and overcome any obstacle that comes her way.
