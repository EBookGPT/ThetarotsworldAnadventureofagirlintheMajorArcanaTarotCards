# Chapter 12: Strength - Overcoming Challenges and Finding Inner Courage

The tarot's world is an ever-changing landscape. The cards have the power to guide us through life's challenges and help us overcome obstacles. In our last chapter, we learned about The Chariot and how it teaches us to take control and overcome obstacles. In this chapter, we explore the card of Strength, which teaches us to find the inner courage to keep moving forward.

As we journey through the Major Arcana Tarot Cards, we are joined by a special guest, Brené Brown. As a renowned researcher on the topic of courage, vulnerability, and shame, she is the perfect person to delve deeper into the meaning of Strength.

The image depicted on the Strength card is that of a woman gently holding open the jaws of a lion. This symbolizes the strength that comes from finding the courage to face our fears and overcome them. In our lives, we often face challenges that make us feel small and powerless. But through the power of inner strength, we can confront and overcome them.

Brené Brown reminds us that courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act despite it. The Strength card teaches us that we all have the capability to find the courage to face our fears and do what must be done.

Through its message of inner strength and finding a way to overcome the seemingly impossible, the Strength card is a reminder that we can overcome anything if we remain steadfast in our belief in ourselves. Let us now journey together, with the strength and courage to face any challenge that lies ahead.
# Chapter 12: Strength - Overcoming Challenges and Finding Inner Courage

Dorothy and her companions, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion, have finally reached the land of Oz. However, they are warned that they must face new challenges that will test their strength and courage.

As they journey towards the Emerald City, the group comes across a dangerous lion who blocks their path. Unlike the cowardly Lion who is traveling with them, this lion is fierce and threatening.

Dorothy remembers the image of Strength from her tarot cards, and with her newfound courage, she steps forward to face the lion. Taking cues from Brené Brown's teachings, Dorothy acknowledges the fear that she feels but does not allow it to hold her back. Instead, she musters the inner strength to stand her ground and face the lion.

The Scarecrow and Tin Man are amazed as they watch Dorothy fearlessly handle the lion, holding open its jaws with ease. They realize the power of inner strength and how it can help them overcome any obstacle.

With the lion defeated, the group continues their journey towards the Emerald City, each with newfound strength and courage.

Finally, they reach the Wizard of Oz, who congratulates them on their bravery and teaches them that the courage they seek has always been within them. Dorothy thanks Brené Brown for providing the tools she needed to tap into her inner strength and overcome her fears.

As they exit the Wizard's chamber, they are filled with a renewed sense of power and confidence. They now know that no matter what challenges come their way, they have the strength and courage to overcome them.

And so, Dorothy and her friends journey on, ready to face whatever the tarot's world has in store for them, fueled by the power of inner strength and courage.
In conclusion, the Strength card in the Major Arcana Tarot has taught us a valuable lesson. It reminds us that we all have the strength and courage within us to face the challenges life throws our way. It is easy to feel powerless and small in the face of adversity, but, as the Wizard of Oz parable showed us, once we find the courage to confront our fears, we become powerful beyond measure. 

With the special guest Brené Brown guiding us, we learned that courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to act in spite of it. And through Dorothy's example, we saw how finding the strength to face our fears can help us overcome even the biggest of obstacles.

As we continue on our journey through the tarot's world, let us remember the lesson of Strength: that we are all capable of rising to meet any challenge, and that with the power of inner strength and courage, we can overcome anything.
