# Chapter 14: The Return Home - The Wizard of Tarot

Our heroine stood at the threshold of The World, a sense of fulfillment washing over her. She had travelled through the Major Arcana meeting different archetypes, embracing their lessons and confronting her deepest fears. 

As she turned towards the illuminated gateway that would take her back home, a little creature appeared before her. He introduced himself as the Wizard of Tarot who had led her through her journey. He had been her guide and mentor, not just through the Major Arcana but in her own real world too.

The Wizard of Tarot took her hand and led her through the portal, a warm and familiar feeling spreading within her heart. But as she took the first step, she realized that her journey was not just about her, but also about all those who would come after her. And she knew it was her duty to pass on the Wizard's teachings and legacy to others.

Just as Dorothy had learned to help her friends, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion; our heroine had learned that the journey of the tarot was not about herself, but about serving those around her. It was about using her newfound knowledge and intuition to help and guide others, just as the Wizard of Tarot had done so for her.

The final lesson of her journey hit her like a thunderbolt - the tarot was not just about understanding the cards, but about using the insights gleaned from the experience to make the world a better place. And so, she emerged from her adventure in the Major Arcana not just with a sense of completion and wholeness, but also with a renewed sense of duty to spread the wisdom of the tarot to others.

The Wizard of Tarot smiled as he watched our heroine return to the real world, knowing that she would go on to be a great teacher and mentor to others, just as he had been for her. And so, the legacy of the tarot was passed down from one generation to another, as each person walked their own journey towards self-discovery, enlightenment, and a better world for all.
In conclusion, the journey through the Major Arcana of the tarot is not just a personal one, but a journey of service towards others. As we confront our fears, embrace our intuition and learn to nurture our creativity, we develop the tools to help others on their own path towards self-discovery and fulfillment. 

Just as Dorothy returned home with a newfound sense of duty to help her friends in need, so too did our heroine emerge from the tarot's adventure with a renewed sense of purpose and responsibility to share the wisdom of the tarot with others. 

The tarot's world is a vast and complex one, with endless lessons to be learned and insights to be gleaned. But through an open heart and an open mind, we can use the lessons of the Major Arcana to make the world a better place, one person at a time.

So let us take the lessons learned and the insights gained from this journey and use them to inspire, uplift, and serve others on their own individual paths. For in doing so, we not only create more fulfilling and enriched lives for ourselves but also contribute to a better world for all.
